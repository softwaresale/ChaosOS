# ChaosOS
A very very simple x86 operating system developed in C and Assembly (NASM)

This is mostly based off of osdev wiki, James Blundell's tutorial, and other tutorials I have found throughout the internet.
This is still a work in progress and will take a long time to complete. However, help is always wonderful
